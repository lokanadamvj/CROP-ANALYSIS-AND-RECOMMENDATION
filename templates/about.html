    <p>ABSTRACT
        In Indian economy and employment agriculture plays major role. The most common problem faced by the Indian farmers is they do not opt crop based on the necessity of soil, as a result they face serious setback in productivity. This problem can be addressed through precision agriculture. This method takes three parameters into consideration, viz: soil characteristics, soil types and crop yield data collection based on these parameters suggesting the farmer suitable crop to be cultivated. Precision agriculture helps in reduction of non-suitable crop which indeed increases productivity, apart from the following advantages like efficacy in input as well as output and better decision making for farming. Crop yield prediction incorporates forecasting the yield of the crop from past historical data which includes factors such as temperature, relative humidity, ph., rainfall and area (Hectares). This method gives solutions like proposing a recommendation system through an ensemble model with majority voting techniques using Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbor as learner to recommend suitable crop based on soil parameters with high specific accuracy and efficiency</p>
     
<h3>PROPOSED SYSTEM </h3>
   <p> • Our proposed system is an application which predicts name of the crop as well 
    as calculate its corresponding yield. 
    • Name of the crop is determined by several features like temperature, humidity, 
    wind-speed, rainfall etc. and yield is determined by the area and production.
    • In this project KNN and Random Forest is used for prediction. It will attain the 
    crop prediction with best accurate values.
